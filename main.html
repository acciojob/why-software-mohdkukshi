        <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

        <p>Becoming a developer isn't just about coding; it's a gateway to crafting innovative solutions and leaving a mark on the digital world.
            The allure lies in the power to create, to build something from scratch that solves real problems. It's about diving into a realm where
            logic and creativity converge, where each line of code shapes possibilities. The thrill of unraveling complex puzzles and seeing a program
            come to life fuels the passion. Being a developer isn't just a profession; it's a journey of continuous learning, where every challenge is
            an opportunity to grow and make a tangible impact in a rapidly evolving landscape.</p>
